🙌 Hi, I'm Fabian!

❤️‍🔥 I'm passionate about web development, textual machine learning, generative art, and generally solving problems with code. Read more about those things [on my coding blog](https://www.fabiandietrich.com/index.html).

👽 My current hobby project / obsession is a Python-based game that simulates alien evolution in a procedurally generated universe.

🏠👉👨‍💻 I used to be an architect (yes, the house-planning version), and I recently started a new career in software development. I'm actively looking for new opportunities, and would be happy to become part of a motivated team in a dynamic technology company! 

🧠 I'm always happy to start a conversation, get to know you, and share ideas!
