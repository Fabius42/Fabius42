👋 Hi, I'm Fabian!

❤️‍🔥 I'm passionate about generative art, LLMs, algorithmic trading, and generally solving problems with code. Read more about those things [on my blog](https://www.fabiandietrich.com).

👽 My current hobby project / obsession is a Python-based game that simulates alien evolution in a procedurally generated universe.

🏠👉👨‍💻 I used to be an architect (yes, the house-planning version), but then I switched to software development, and more recently to entrepreneurship.

🧠 I'm always happy to start a conversation, get to know you, and share ideas!

📫 You can reach me via fd (at) fabiandietrich (dot) com
